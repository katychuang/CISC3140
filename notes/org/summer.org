This is the summer version of the course that is condensed to 5 weeks. In the *Lecture Notes* section below, each module is meant to be covered during 1 week of the course. Within each module are between 3-5 topics, each with a set of /Learning Objectives/ and /Activities/ outlined.

The contents of this document is intended to serve both students who are taking the course and the instructor re-teaching the course.

Each section is meant to be followed sequentially from Module 1 and Topic 1 through the end.

Typically in a week there are certain required activities a student must complete to show minimal engagement with the course material:

+ *Open book quiz* to ensure students knows where to reference materials for that week (Friday)

/Instructor note/ This weekly "checkpoint" structure seems to work well for the because there are a vast number of "new things" that the students are learning in this course for the first time ever. Weekly checks are constructed to ensure different levels of cognition are utilized with the course material. Due dates are spread over different days to aid in student's time management abilities and also to help with the workflow of grading turnaround time.
*** Design of Homework Activities

The first homework assignment focuses on the challenges of communication and more specifically, shared decision making "on the fly" without any communication policies in place. The rest of the homeworks are more technical in nature, meaning the student will have to practice looking for and reading technical documents to complete certain suggested tasks.

*** Required activities

Typically in a week there are certain required activities a student must complete to show minimal engagement with the course material:

+ Open book quiz to ensure students knows where to reference materials for that week (Friday)
+ An activity based on reflecting over the lecture and reading (Sunday)
+ Hands on homework assignment related to the module (Tuesday)

All items must be completed by their due dates for full points. It is expected that students adopt a calendar app to keep track of due dates, as the course is very fast pace.h

*** Extra Credit activities

The goal of extra credit is to enhance absorption of the course material, by allowing students to summarize their reading or class discussion activity to wiki pages.

The purpose of the wiki is to potentially serve as a study guide for the final exam at the end of the semester.

This course covers the tip of the iceberg on the principles used in software development. The goals for this course is for the student to gain proficiency in the collaborative software development process and develop analytical and expressive fluency in ability to work with a wide range of tooling. Mastery of fundamental principles in software engineering is a critical component to realize software applications and web technologies as a unified whole. Through take-home assignments, readings, and team projects students develop a range of abilities to abosrb and articulate critical information.

#+OPTIONS: toc:4
#+TOC: headlines 1 local

In this first week, we focus on the world of software development as a whole.

In lecture 1, we start with what is software, what is the purpose of software, and why is software created? By whom? For whom? These are some of the questions to think about why a software project exists, to better understand the overall context.

Next in lecture 2 we start looking at the role of the software development team and some of the challenges they face in delivering quality. This is to help you start reflecting about what you know relating to software development today.

In lecture 3 we start looking at the software team, how the structure of team organization relates to collaborating on project(s).

This week is more focused on communication. There are no programming assignments, but instead there is a group activity where you discuss with your group to try making a group decision.
